I have made dear relationships with members and staff at this gym. Their example and support have helped me become a better person, mentally, physically and spiritually. They offer writing classes, art classes, rock climbing classes, yoga classes, aerobic classes, and crossfit classes for all levels of fitness. They host in-house 12-step meetings and hold support groups. They host outdoor runs, hikes and rock climbing. They host teams for indoor-volleyball, indoor-soccer, and softball.

# 		body: "To say that Fit to Recover is a special place would be the understatement of the century. If FTR could be summed up into one word (although it's SO much more than one word could ever fulfill), it would be gratitude - gratitude for the opportunity to volunteer with this incredible non-profit organization for the past nearly two years; gratitude for the many experiences that I have shared and look forward to sharing with those who are involved with FTR; and gratitude for this platform to share what FTR means to me with anyone who is currently a member of FTR or contemplating becoming a member of FTR. Personally, FTR has taught me that it's okay to be vulnerable and talk about how you're feeling. There is tremendous power in numbers and community, and not everything in life needs to be tackled alone. If you're looking for a safe place to build a community and feel like you belong, come check out what FTR is all about. Take a fitness class, attend a nutrition workshop, sign up for a creative writing session, serve those in need via community outreach events, or record a song to document your recovery journey. Most importantly, find what works best for you and your personal recovery. Give it a chance and you'll feel the warmth, support, and authenticity of those around you. You won't regret it. ~ Steph, FTR Dietitian"
